## Overview

Large parametric language models have achieved dramatic empirical success across many applications. However, these models lack several desirable properties such as explainability (providing provenance), privacy (ability to remove knowledge from the model), robust controllability, and debuggability. On the other hand, nonparametric models provide many of these features by design such as provenance, ability to incorporate/remove information. However, these models often suffer from weaker empirical performance as compared to deep parametric models.

Recently, many works have independently proposed a middle ground that combines a parametric model (that encodes logic) with a nonparametric model (that retrieves knowledge) in various areas from question answering over natural languages to complex reasoning over knowledge bases to even protein structure predictions. Given the increasingly promising results on various tasks of such [semiparametric model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiparametric_model), we believe this area is ripe for targeted investigation on understanding efficiency, generalization, limitations, widening its applicability, etc. As a result, we want to host a workshop on this topic.

Our workshop hosts keynote talks as well as seeks paper submissions (either archival or non-archival) on this topic. Please check out our [Call for Papers](cfp)!

## Important Dates

(All AoE)
- Submission deadline: February 28th, 2022
- Submission deadline (with ARR reviews): March 19th, 2022
- Notification of acceptance: March 26th, 2022
- Camera-ready paper deadline: April 10th, 2022
- Workshop date: May 26th or 27th, 2022 (TBA)

## Submission guidelines
We seek submissions of original work or work-in-progress. Submissions can be in the form of long/short papers and should follow the ACL main conference template. We will follow double-blind review process. Authors can choose to make their paper achival/non-archival. All accepted papers will be presented at the workshop.
We also will accept ACL rolling review (ARR) submissions with reviews. Since these submissions already come with reviews, the submission deadline is much later than the initial deadline.

<!-- Non-archival track also seeks recently accepted / published work---it does not need to be anonymized and will not go through the review process. The submission should clearly indicate the original venue and will be accepted if the organizers think the work will benefit from exposure to the audience of this workshop. -->


We will use Open Review for the submissions.
